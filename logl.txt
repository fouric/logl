learn opengl tutorial stuff

opengl is a state machine
the opengl state is referred to as the opengl context
when using opengl, we usually change the state/context by setting some options and manipulating some buffers, and then issue a render command that implicitly uses that context
there are state-changing and state-using opengl functions - identify and separate
an opengl object is a thing like a C record that is a collection of options that represents a subset of opengl state
